# Jetpack Compose Text-Based Game

An unfinished but functional Android game created entirely with Jetpack Compose. The game takes inspiration from other text-based mobile games and puts the player in the role of operating and managing a business.

## Architecture

This project was created with the hope of getting a better understanding of Clean Architecture with an MVVM Framework and using Dagger Hilt for dependency injection. 

### Features

Each aspect of the game is broken down into a feature and has a file structure like the one shown here:

ğŸ“¦feature_example\
 â”£ ğŸ“‚data\
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚data_source\
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚repository\
